Build a small, interactive, and engaging web app demo to showcase the capabilities of the Gemini model and Google technology at the GDGoC Club Day event. The goal is to attract interest and new club member registrations. The product will be named "Career Compass".

Target Audience:

New and current students at FPTU HCMC.

Required Technologies:

Frontend: Use React to build the user interface (not using Tailwind CSS). This will ensure a smooth and responsive application that is easy to manage.

Backend: Use Firebase as the backend-as-a-service. Specific services to be used:

Firebase Hosting: For quick and stable app deployment.

Firebase Authentication (Anonymous): To manage temporary user sessions, allowing for an immediate, no-login experience.

Cloud Firestore: For data storage (if needed).

Firebase Functions: To handle API calls to Gemini, ensuring the API key remains secure.

AI Model: Integrate the Gemini model to handle the core logic of the application.

Application Flow (User Journey):

Landing Page:

Upon first access, users will see a large, eye-catching banner about the GDGoC FPTU Club.

The page will have an engaging title, such as: "Discover Your Career Path with AI" or "Career Compass: An AI-Powered Career Guide".

A prominent, easy-to-see button: "Discover Your Path".

When a user clicks this button, the page will smoothly scroll down to the input section.

Stage 1: Initial Career Direction (AI #1)

The input section will include a few simple questions:

Main Major: (e.g., "Information Technology," "Marketing," "Business").

Favorite Skills: (e.g., "Web Programming," "Data Analysis," "Writing").

Personality: (Choose from a list: "Introverted," "Extroverted," "Team-Oriented").

When the user submits the information, the app will generate and send a prompt to the Gemini API via Firebase Functions. This prompt will instruct Gemini to act as a "Personal Career Advisor".

Sample Prompt (sent to AI):

You are an AI career advisor. Based on the user's major [Major], favorite skill [Skill], and personality [Personality], suggest a suitable career path. Provide 2-3 specific reasons why it's a good fit and suggest a simple personal project they can start. Answer in a concise, friendly tone and use English. Example for a project: 'Build a small e-commerce web app to practice backend skills.'

Stage 2: Job Market Analysis (AI #2)

After receiving the career direction from Stage 1, a new button will appear: "Analyze the Market".

When the user clicks this button, a second prompt will be sent to Gemini (also via Firebase Functions). This prompt will instruct Gemini to act as a "Labor Market Analyst".

Sample Prompt (sent to AI):

You are a labor market analyst. Analyze the current job market for the position '[Career Path from previous step]'. Provide insights on: 1) The growth potential of this field in Vietnam. 2) Key required skills. 3) Average salary range for new graduates. 4) Top companies in this field. Answer in a clear, professional tone and use English.

Development Notes:

Security: The Gemini API key must never be exposed on the frontend. All API calls must be handled securely through Firebase Functions.

UI/UX Design: The theme should be white/blue/red/orange/green, related to Google, basic and friendly to everyone. The interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, especially the banner and "Discover" button. Ensure smooth transition effects.

Result Presentation: Instead of just showing plain text, consider using icons, charts, or text formatting (bolding, bullet points) to make the results more appealing and easy to read.
